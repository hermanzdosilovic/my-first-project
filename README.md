# My First Project

Today (October 26th 2016) I was browsing my old files from high school and I found
my first project I wrote when I was in the second grade. This "final" release, as
I called it back then, was finished on December 5th 2010 (I was 15 years old).  

Back then, in high school, we were learning C using C++ compiler so I didn't really know what language I was learning and what
language I was writing. I just knew that it will run if I press F5 in good old [Bloodshed Dev-C++](http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html).

I still have almost all the code I wrote back then and it's really heartwarming
to read those lines of unindented, replicated, unoptimized and not tested code, and this one is really special to me. This is
the first, my first project that I was proud of when it was finished.

If you are reading this and you are beginner in programming, remember that every
programmer you will ever meet had to start with simple "hello world" program.
Don't lose hope if you don't get it from the first try, keep trying and you will
succeed. Write code as much as you can, until you fall a sleep at the desk, and you
will succeed.

And if you are already experienced developer, I challenge you to post your first
project, write few words about it and motivate young and inexperienced who just
started sailing in this endless world of computer science and software engineering.
